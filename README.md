# Traffic Sim

This project aims to answer many questions about traffic that I ponder while stuck in the notorious LA/OC traffic.

The eventual testing will be approached from a "Mythbusters" perspective, targetting specific hunches such as:

* The slow lane moves faster than the fast lane in rush hour traffic

* Highway patrol are a significant factor in traffic without any stops/arrests being made

* Giving "sufficient room" actually increases traffic

* Speeding up to let a driver merge behind is better than slowing down to let them merge ahead

... and other questions as they appear.
